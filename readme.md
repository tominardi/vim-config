# tominardi vim configuration

Hey, this is my place, I can write what I want.

This is just my vim configuration repository, to share it between all my environments.

So I write only for myself, even if I let the repo in public mode.

Feel free to send me pull request so I can improve my configuration.

## How to use it

Hello Tom, how are you ?

So you want to set up a new environment because you get a lot of money so you buyed a new computer ? Lucky you.

Just git clone this repo on your home directory, in a `.vim` directory :

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tominardi/vim-config.git ~/.vim
```

Then create a symlink for the .vimrc file :

```bash
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Ans install the plugins

```bash
vim +PlugInstall +qall  # Install the plugins
```

And that's it.
